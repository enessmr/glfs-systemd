          Security Vulnerabilities
        </h2>
        <p>
          A security vulnerability, or a CVE, is a flaw in source code that
          can be used to harm the user(s) and/or the system in use, sometimes
          by abusing buffer overflows to achieve privilege escalation,
          modifying generated build scripts to use ssh at startup, or even
          messing with stale memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many packages that push out updates that fix
          vulnerabilties, and some packages fix CVEs pretty often. GLFS will
          ocassionally have an update that upgrades a package that fixes a
          CVE. It's important to always upgrade packages on your system that
          contain security vulnerabilities, and there is a way for checking
          for those updates.
        </p>

          Checking for Security Updates
        </h2>
        <p>
          To check for packages that have had a CVE fixed, go to the
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://github.com/glfs-book/glfs/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity">
          GLFS issue page</a> that has a filter enabled (<code class=
          "computeroutput">is:closed is:issue label:security</code>). All
          packages listed there that have the <code class=
          "computeroutput">security</code> label are packages that fixed a
          CVE in the version listed. Newer versions will be at the top of the
          list. When there are two versions of the same package, always go
          with the one that appears first in the list, or the top of it.
          Newer doesn't always mean safer, and it may sometimes be necessary
          to use an older version of a package, plus maybe a patch or two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take note that the packages listed there are issues that have
          already been closed and are now in the book. You can go to the open
          section of the page to see if there are packages there that are
          still having details worked out and have yet to be fixed in the
          book. For most people, the closed section of the page is most
          important.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have found a package of note, you can go to the issue to
          see specific CVEs that were fixed. Once you have reviewed the
          ticket, you can then decide if you want to update the package
          listed. The most secure version is in the book unless a version of
          that package is in the open section of the page linked above.
