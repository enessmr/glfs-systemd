      <p>
        Within the GLFS instructions, each package has two references for
        finding the source files for the package—an HTTP link and an FTP link
        (some packages may only list one of these links). Every effort has
        been made to ensure that these links are accurate. However, the World
        Wide Web is in continuous flux. Packages are sometimes moved or
        updated and the exact URL specified is not always available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BLFS Team noticed this problem with BLFS, so they, with the
        assistance of Oregon State University Open Source Lab, have made an
        HTTP/FTP site available through world wide mirrors. See <a class=
        "ulink" href=
        "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources</a>
        for a list. These sites have all the sources of the exact versions of
        the packages used in BLFS. If you can't find the BLFS or GLFS package
        you need at the listed addresses, get it from these sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to ask a favor, however. Although this is a public
        resource for you to use, please do not abuse it. They have already
        had one unthinking individual download over 3 GB of data, including
        multiple copies of the same files that are placed at different
        locations (via symlinks) to make finding the right package easier.
        This person clearly did not know what files he needed and downloaded
        everything. The best place to download files is the site or sites set
        up by the source code developer. Please try there first.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for GLFS, some packages listed here are not on BLFS or their site.
        In such a case, we do not have a solution at the moment besides going
        to the developer(s) and/or their website.

          Obtaining the Source Packages in Bulk
        </h2>
        <p>
          Obtaining all the source packages all at once is not recommended as
          you will probably pull in packages you won't want. However, it is
          certainly a convenient option if you have the disk space to spare
          and may be necessary if the LFS system cannot download any source
          code, but another system can, such as the host you built the LFS
          target from.

            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            This process depends on <a class="xref" href=
            "../shareddeps/wget.html" title="Wget-1.25.0">Wget-1.25.0</a>. It
            also depends on a working internet connection. If you just got
            done with LFS and are not yet booted into the new system yet,
            then it is recommended to navigate to <code class=
            "filename">$LFS/sources</code> then follow the below instructions
            on the host system outside of a chroot.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          First navigate to the directory you want the downloaded source code
          and patches to be, then download <a class="ulink" href=
          "../wget-list">wget-list</a>. After that, download the packages and
          patches by doing the following:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">wget -N --input-file=wget-list --continue</kbd></pre>
