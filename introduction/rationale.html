      <p>
        Upon reading through some of the sections in this book, you may
        notice that a lot of the packages linked in some of the sections
        aren't in this book but rather in BLFS, some optional dependencies
        aren't listed, some packages may be outdated, and some packages that
        have test suites don't have test instructions. These choices are very
        much deliberate.

          Why Are Many Packages Not in the Book?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many packages linked on some of the packages' sections aren't in
          the book but rather in the BLFS book. There are multiple reasons
          for this, but the most notable one is the packages that aren't in
          the book aren't important for the main packages in the book, those
          being <span class="application">Steam</span> and <span class=
          "application">Wine</span>. They are still listed anyway if users
          want more support out of the specific packages not specific to the
          main packages, like media playback for example. Another reason for
          packages not being in the book is that the packages take a lot of
          work to install and require jumping around. They can also require a
          lot of choice or take up space or RAM for no real benefit for a lot
          of users when there are more simple solutions.

          Why Are Some Optional Dependencies Not Listed?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are some optional dependencies that aren't listed, and the
          main reason for this is that they just would take up unnecessary
          space. If on the offchance you desire even more out of your system,
          there are plenty more packages in BLFS and BLFS is more geared for
          everyone, although this book focuses more on gaming. Usually the
          optional dependencies that are not listed are those that are needed
          for testing builds and generating documentation.

          Packages That Are Outdated and Why
        </h2>
        <p>
          No packages are currently outdated at time of release.

          Some Package Test Instructions Aren't Included
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many packages have test suites which can test a given build for any
          potential bugs and may tell you if something has gone wrong.
          However, in GLFS, a lot of these packages have test suites that
          depend on packages that aren't necessary in the book and would make
          this book larger than it needs to be. Furthermore, a lot of the
          packages that do have test suites aren't involved with critical
          components of the system and don't tend to have bugs that come up
          as a result of a build, but rather the released source code itself.
          If you want to do test suites of a given package, BLFS has good
          instructions for that on each package and covers all the required
          dependencies, as well as instructions on how to install those
          dependencies.
