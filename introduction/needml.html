        Now that you have an idea of what multilib is, it is time to decide
        whether to enable that support or not. Depending on the circumstance,
        it may be necessary.

          Steam
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most gamers would not know this unless they push the limits of the
          games they play, but many games on Steam are 32-bit. Some games are
          no longer receiving updates while some are still being updated but
          are still 32-bit to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only are a lot of games 32-bit, but Steam itself requires that
          you have 32-bit libraries. If the 32-bit libraries aren't on the
          system, Steam will quit, saying it needs a library such as
          <code class="filename">libc.so.6</code>. You will need the ability
          to execute 32-bit applications as well as all the libraries
          necessary which is laid out in Chapter 3.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sect2">
          Wine
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unlike Steam, Wine does not require that you have 32-bit libraries
          or the i686-w64-mingw32 toolchain. Moreover, to get multilib
          support in Wine, it must be compiled twice: a w64 build and a w32
          w/ w64 build. However, it was discussed eariler in the Steam
          section that many games are 32-bit and are no longer maintained or
          will take a while to switch to 64-bit. This is the case with
          Windows applications as well. This means that if you do a 64-bit
          only build, compatabilty for all those 32-bit applications will be
          lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Wine WoW64 (can run 32-bit and 64-bit applications) build is
          recommended. You can however skip lib32 and i686 instructions to
          get a pure w64 Wine installation.
