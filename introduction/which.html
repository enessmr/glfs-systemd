        GLFS stands as a format in between LFS and BLFS so this part is
        crucial to understanding what you need to read and/or follow in order
        to get out of the system that you desire. For starters, LFS is meant
        to be followed in a linear manner, whereas BLFS handles things by
        putting related packages in the sections they are best described as
        categorically. For example, printer software being in a printer
        section, although most packages can be discarded by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every chapter/section will be necessary depending on what you
        want. Some packages may also not be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, every user should read the multilib chapter. If that
        chapter is skipped, you might get a headache later on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following section is Shared Dependencies. Every user who wants
        <span class="application">Steam</span> and/or <span class=
        "application">Wine</span> will want to read this chapter as both
        projects use the packages. Most of this chapter is necessary.
        However, it is recommended to check the dependency lists of Steam and
        Wine to see what exactly you need from a given section. If you are in
        doubt, (re)install all of the listed packages in that chapter. If you
        don't use them in this book, it still may be useful for some packages
        in BLFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next section is Steam, which covers all the packages, patches,
        configuration, and setup necessary to get <span class=
        "application">Steam</span> working and capable of the playing the
        following: Linux games, Windows games via Proton, and games using
        OpenGL, Vulkan, and Direct3D.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following section that most users will need is Wine. Users should
        follow every step in this chapter if they want to install WoW64
        <span class="application">Wine</span>, but more information is
        covered in that chapter. The Wine chapter at the moment does not
        consider retrofitting and will handle it in a similar manner to Arch:
        build the MinGW-w64 toolchain, install the audio and video
        components, then finally <span class="application">Wine</span>
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last section covers quality of life improvements and packages.
        This chapter is not required but recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you enjoy using GLFS and that it provides you most of your
        gaming needs!
