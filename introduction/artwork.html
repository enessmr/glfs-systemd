          <p>
            It has been scrapped in GLFS because of the low quality and has
            no transparent background. This is the same reason as a number of
            different legacy images for boxes. Those images were all added
            and scrapped the same day, they just have different purposes and
            will be noted as such.

            This one strays from the old design as trying to replicate the
            hand design would prove difficult. Thus, the speech bubble design
            was decided instead. Beyond that, nothing special of note.

          <div class="mediaobject">
            <img src="../images/legacy/glfs-logo.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Used from June 6th, 2024 to June 25th, 2024.
          </p>
          <p>
            Added by Zeckma on June 6th, 2024, it was the main logo used to
            represent GLFS for a little over two weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main idea behind the design is that the base LFS packages are
            on the gaming computer, and the <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">G</span>”</span> that sits on top of the LFS packages
            enabled gaming support. The <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">G</span>”</span> box is much bigger than the LFS boxes
            because it takes a decent amount of packages to get gaming
            support on LFS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another part of the design was to get away from the puzzle piece
            symbol for different reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creation of this icon was painful and clumsy, but it was to
            be the favicon for the site. It was later replaced by a better
            logo on June 25th, 2024 due to how it was simply not an ideal
            favicon and was hard to make out any important details, whereas
            using the main <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">G</span>”</span> box as the favicon would be painfully
            plain due to the dull colors.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <h3 class="sect3">

              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>
            Added by Zeckma on June 25th, 2024, it is the current logo used
            to represent GLFS.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was made to replace the old logo but still have one or two
            elements come over from the old design, the main one being the
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">G</span>”</span> box,
            although much more stylized. It no longer acts as the favicon for
            the site but shows up at the top of the home page.
          </p>
          <p>
            There isn't much meaning within the logo, although there is some.
            Namely, the dragon and tech elements of the design is meant to
            convey the general theme of gaming. The dragon itself as depicted
            has its gender ambiguous, but nonetheless stoic and focused to
            better represent the wide variety of people that may wish to
            follow this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dragon, or GLFS mascot, does not actually have a name (yet),
            but may recieve one in the future and may recieve more art
            depicting the character.
