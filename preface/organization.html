        dependencies they both depend on. Anything specific to <span class=
        "application">Steam</span> and <span class="application">Wine</span>
        are covered in their respective chapters.
      </p>

      </h2>
      <p>

        required, as well as some configuration for certain packages.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part IV - Wine
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section goes over installing a toolchain called <span class=
        "application">MinGW-w64</span>, some of the packages necessary to
        both compile <span class="application">Wine</span> and use it, and
        lastly how to compile <span class="application">Wine</span> and
        configure it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Part V - Quality of Life
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section goes over quality of life improvements and packages to
        improve the experience with the system after following the main part
        of the book.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Appendices
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Appendices present information which doesn't belong in the body
        of book; they are included as reference material. The glossary of
        acronyms is a handy feature.
