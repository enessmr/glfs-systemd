      <p>
        Sometime after my first install of LFS, I had a question that others
        had: how do I install <span class="application">Steam</span> on this
        system? I kept that thought in the back of my head as I went for
        Beyond LFS, a book that covered a good number of packages I needed.
        However, the issue of <span class="application">Steam</span> was not
        cleared up yet. So I just tried to install the <span class=
        "application">Steam</span> tarball. Because I did not have 32-bit
        libraries, this ended in failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond LFS doesn't cover the installation of Steam, so I had to look
        elsewhere. I learned shortly after my attempt that I needed a
        multilib toolchain. I sent an <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/arc/blfs-support/2023-03/msg00049.html">
        email</a> to the blfs-support mailing list in search of potential
        multilib support. Douglas Reno saw my email and suggested to give
        Thomas' Multilib branch a read. I rebuilt my LFS system with multilib
        support in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rahul Chandra in the same thread mentioned his scripts for his
        distro, Tucana. These scripts gave me a basic idea of how to do lib32
        installations for BLFS packages which were necessary for <span class=
        "application">Steam.</span>. While this wasn't exactly difficult, it
        was a big timesink as I had to manually type in all the lib32
        compilation options to successfully build 32-bit libraries. Even
        after having built all the 32-bit libraries required, a few more
        fixes and files were necessary. After about a week, I managed to get
        <span class="application">Steam</span> working. I realized that this
        was a lot of work, and many users who'd want to do the same thing
        would get stuck and not know what to do. In the worst case, they'd
        give up before even reaching their goal. I had made a pretty
        lackluster <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ8ueeRZ5q0">YouTube video</a>
        explaining some troubleshooting information in an attempt to make
        things a bit easier. Shortly after the video, I realized it wasn't
        really good enough. Knowledge and methods are one thing, but hours
        spent is another. I put my ambitions for an easier guide on my
        backlog and did other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometime afterwards, I decided to do a <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_vcsK5qbWSv-70zpfFcol_D9yovtf6N6">
        stream series</a> that included that installation of <span class=
        "application">Wine</span>, not just <span class=
        "application">Steam</span>. My general idea was to compile all the
        stream footage (roughly 40 GB worth) into a single video master
        guide. When some time passed, I came to the conclusion that for a
        installation guide for two complex packages on an LFS system, a video
        is not a great format. I decided to then write up some basic
        <a class="ulink" href="../archive/swlfs.html">HTML</a>. Rahul Chandra
        came across my <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYrmltSQNdtsbpsbhZI3wg/community?lb=UgkxDlke0llHGWxC7HpzVyv24K8XcsWFF8Dn">
        YouTube post</a> and reached out to me. He suggested that I should
        reuse the LFS/BLFS codebase to make my own book. That led to this
        book's creation and editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully this book does its job. Have fun, and good luck!
