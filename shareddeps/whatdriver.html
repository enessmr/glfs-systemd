      <p>
        On Linux, there are multiple drivers that one can install. Choosing
        the one you need can be difficult if you do not know what drivers are
        for what vendor and the perks and downsides of each option. This
        section explains all of that to better help you decide what you want
        or need.

          Gallium3D is a technology that <a class="xref" href="mesa.html"
          title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a> relies on for OpenGL. In other
          words, Gallium3D drivers are just OpenGL drivers. Each Gallium3D
          driver is meant for different systems except <code class=
          "computeroutput">zink</code> which just feeds OpenGL instructions
          to the main Vulkan driver you install for your system.

          There are 3 AMD GPU drivers: AMDGPU (Radeon Southern Islands and
          later), ATI (r300 and r600), and AMDGPU PRO (proprietary AMDGPU
          driver).

          href="mesa.html" title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a>): This driver
          is for AMD GPUs that are Southern Island Cards or later. It is open
          source and is the most standard AMD GPU driver. This driver is in
          the Linux kernel. There is one Gallium3D driver, <code class=
          "computeroutput">radeonsi</code>, and one Vulkan driver,
          <code class="computeroutput">amd</code>.

          "mesa.html" title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a>): This driver is
          for the ATI AMD GPUs which precede GCN GPUs. It is open source and
          targets older GPUs. The driver is in the Linux kernel. There are
          two Gallium3D drivers: <code class="computeroutput">r300</code> and
          <code class="computeroutput">r600</code>. For Vulkan, there is one

          driver is proprietary. Most users don't install this driver as the
          open source drivers are already well off. However, it is needed for
          hardware acceleration encoding, useful for those who wish to record
          and edit videos. Performance in games varies between the open
          source and proprietary drivers so the ending factor is if you
          record and edit videos or not. You will need the firmware and open
          source kernel driver for this driver.

        <p>
          Summary: If you are a regular user with a modern AMD GPU, use
          <span class="emphasis"><em>AMDGPU</em></span>. If you have an older
          card, go with <span class="emphasis"><em>ATI</em></span>. Use
          <span class="emphasis"><em>AMDGPU PRO</em></span> if you want an
          improvement with hardware acceleration encoding.

        <p>
          Intel provides open source drivers, but for sake of simplicity, all
          the relevant open source drivers will be classified as one -
          <span class="emphasis"><em>i915</em></span>. There is another

          rather collection of drivers, is for most Intel integrated and
          discrete GPUs. It is a single option in the Linux kernel but has
          various Gallium3D and Vulkan drivers. There is a good list on the
          <a class="xref" href="mesa.html" title=

          core. This driver was in the kernel since 3.5 but no longer since
          4.15. This driver is not included in the book because of its lack
          of use by most people, but has a good Arch Linux wiki page at

          NVIDIA
        </h2>
        <p>
          The situation revolving around NVIDIA is more unfortunate than the
          two vendors listed above and more complicated. NVIDIA does not
          support open source drivers besides their own open source kernel
          modules. Therefore performance with the open source driver,
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span>, is slightly worse
          than NVIDIA's proprietary driver. Installing the proprietary driver
          can also be easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span> (<a class="xref"
          href="mesa.html" title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a>): This driver
          is open source but has generally worse performance than
          <span class="emphasis"><em>NVIDIA</em></span>. The driver is in the
          Linux kernel. It has one Gallium3D driver, <code class=
          "computeroutput">nouveau</code>, and one Vulkan driver,
          <code class="computeroutput">nouveau</code> <a href="#ftn.id9489"
          class="footnote" id="id9489" name="id9489"><sup class=
          "footnote">[2]</sup></a>. The Gallium3D driver is known for its
          lackluster performance. The Vulkan driver is much more performant.
          For this reason, if you want to use <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span>, it is highly recommended to
          install the Vulkan driver as well the <code class=
          "computeroutput">zink</code> Gallium3D driver so that OpenGL
          instructions can be fed into the Vulkan driver.

          This is the proprietary driver and the performance of this driver
          is better than the open source alternative. It allows the use of
          NVIDIA's CUDA project which is useful for hardware acceleration,
          improving performance of games and workstation applications. This
          driver has a lot of issues to this day but still provides better
          performance, thus its installation is provided in this book.
          Firmware isn't needed as it is provided by this driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summary: If you want good performance and care about workstation
          use cases, install <span class="emphasis"><em>NVIDIA</em></span>.
          If you don't want to use the proprietary NVIDIA driver, use
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Nouveau</em></span>. Installing
          <code class="computeroutput">zink</code> is a good idea, too.
