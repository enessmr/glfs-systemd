          Introduction to make-ca
        </h2>
        <p>
          Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a method to validate the
          authenticity of an otherwise unknown entity across untrusted
          networks. PKI works by establishing a chain of trust, rather than
          trusting each individual host or entity explicitly. In order for a
          certificate presented by a remote entity to be trusted, that
          certificate must present a complete chain of certificates that can
          be validated using the root certificate of a Certificate Authority
          (CA) that is trusted by the local machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Establishing trust with a CA involves validating things like
          company address, ownership, contact information, etc., and ensuring
          that the CA has followed best practices, such as undergoing
          periodic security audits by independent investigators and
          maintaining an always available certificate revocation list. This
          is well outside the scope of BLFS (as it is for most Linux
          distributions). The certificate store provided here is taken from
          the Mozilla Foundation, who have established very strict inclusion
          policies described <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/">

        <p>
          The <span class="application">make-ca</span> script will download
          and process the certificates included in the <code class=
          "filename">certdata.txt</code> file for use as trust anchors for
          the <a class="xref" href="p11-kit.html" title=
          "p11-kit-0.25.5">p11-kit-0.25.5</a> trust module. Additionally, it
          will generate system certificate stores used by BLFS applications
          (if the recommended and optional applications are present on the
          system). Any local certificates stored in <code class=
          "filename">/etc/ssl/local</code> will be imported to both the trust
          anchors and the generated certificate stores (overriding Mozilla's
          trust). Additionally, any modified trust values will be copied from
          the trust anchors to <code class="filename">/etc/ssl/local</code>
          prior to any updates, preserving custom trust values that differ
          from Mozilla when using the <span class=
          "command"><strong>trust</strong></span> utility from <span class=
          "application">p11-kit</span> to operate on the trust store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you can install the package, you should add an extra
          instruction to the <span class="application">make-ca</span> script
          that makes a compatibility symlink that is used by Debian Linux
          packages and is required by <a class="xref" href=
          "../steam/steam.html" title="Steam-1.0.0.83">Steam-1.0.0.83</a> as
          its main development is done on Debian Linux. Add that instruction
          to the script now:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">cat &gt;&gt; make-ca &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class=
"literal">ln -svf /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
</code>EOF</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Now to install the <span class="application">make-ca</span> script,
          it must be installed into the correct location as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user:
        </p>
        <pre class="root"><kbd class="command">make install &amp;&amp;

          <p>
            Technically, this package is already installed at this point. But
            most packages listing <span class="application">make-ca</span> as
            a dependency actually require the system certificate store set up
            by this package, rather than the <span class=
            "command"><strong>make-ca</strong></span> program itself. So the
            instructions for using <span class=
            "command"><strong>make-ca</strong></span> for setting up the
            system certificate store are included in this section.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          As the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user, download the

        <p>
          For most users, no additional configuration is necessary, however,
          the default <code class="filename">certdata.txt</code> file
          provided by make-ca is obtained from the mozilla-release branch,
          and is modified to provide a Mercurial revision. This will be the
          correct version for most systems. There are several other variants
          of the file available for use that might be preferred for one
          reason or another, including the files shipped with Mozilla
          products in this book. RedHat and OpenSUSE, for instance, use the
          version included in <a class="xref" href="nss.html" title=
          "NSS-3.112">nss-3.112</a>. Additional upstream downloads are
          available at the links included in <code class=
          "filename">/etc/make-ca/make-ca.conf.dist</code>. Simply copy the
          file to <code class="filename">/etc/make-ca.conf</code> and edit as
          appropriate.
        </p>
        <h3>
          About Trust Arguments
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are three trust types that are recognized by the <span class=
          "application">make-ca</span> script, SSL/TLS, S/Mime, and code
          signing. For <span class="application">OpenSSL</span>, these are
          <em class="parameter"><code>serverAuth</code></em>, <em class=
          "parameter"><code>emailProtection</code></em>, and <em class=
          "parameter"><code>codeSigning</code></em> respectively. If one of
          the three trust arguments is omitted, the certificate is neither
          trusted, nor rejected for that role. Clients that use <span class=
          "application">OpenSSL</span> or <span class=
          "application">NSS</span> encountering this certificate will present
          a warning to the user. Clients using <span class=
          "application">GnuTLS</span> without <span class=
          "application">p11-kit</span> support are not aware of trusted
          certificates. To include this CA into the <code class=
          "filename">ca-bundle.crt</code>, <code class=
          "filename">email-ca-bundle.crt</code>, or <code class=
          "filename">objsign-ca-bundle.crt</code> files (the <span class=
          "application">GnuTLS</span> legacy bundles), it must have the
          appropriate trust arguments.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Adding Additional CA Certificates
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code class="filename">/etc/ssl/local</code> directory is
          available to add additional CA certificates to the system trust
          store. This directory is also used to store certificates that were
          added to or modified in the system trust store by <a class="xref"
          href="p11-kit.html" title="p11-kit-0.25.5">p11-kit-0.25.5</a> so
          that trust values are maintained across upgrades. Files in this
          directory must be in the <span class="application">OpenSSL</span>
          trusted certificate format. Certificates imported using the
          <span class="command"><strong>trust</strong></span> utility from
          <a class="xref" href="p11-kit.html" title=
          "p11-kit-0.25.5">p11-kit-0.25.5</a> will utilize the x509 Extended
          Key Usage values to assign default trust values for the system
          anchors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to override trust values, or otherwise need to create
          an <span class="application">OpenSSL</span> trusted certificate
          manually from a regular PEM encoded file, you need to add trust
          arguments to the <span class=
          "command"><strong>openssl</strong></span> command, and create a new
          certificate. For example, using the <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert</a> roots, if you want to trust
          both for all three roles, the following commands will create
          appropriate OpenSSL trusted certificates (run as the <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code> user after is installed):
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">wget http://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt &amp;&amp;
wget http://www.cacert.org/certs/class3.crt &amp;&amp;
openssl x509 -in root.crt -text -fingerprint -setalias "CAcert Class 1 root" \
        -addtrust serverAuth -addtrust emailProtection -addtrust codeSigning \
        &gt; /etc/ssl/local/CAcert_Class_1_root.pem &amp;&amp;
openssl x509 -in class3.crt -text -fingerprint -setalias "CAcert Class 3 root" \
        -addtrust serverAuth -addtrust emailProtection -addtrust codeSigning \
        &gt; /etc/ssl/local/CAcert_Class_3_root.pem &amp;&amp;

/usr/sbin/make-ca -r</kbd></pre>
        <h3>
          Overriding Mozilla Trust
        </h3>
        <p>
          Occasionally, there may be instances where you don't agree with
          Mozilla's inclusion of a particular certificate authority. If you'd
          like to override the default trust of a particular CA, simply
          create a copy of the existing certificate in <code class=
          "filename">/etc/ssl/local</code> with different trust arguments.
          For example, if you'd like to distrust the "Makebelieve_CA_Root"
          file, run the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/Makebelieve_CA_Root.pem \
             -text \
             -fingerprint \
             -setalias "Disabled Makebelieve CA Root" \
             -addreject serverAuth \
             -addreject emailProtection \
             -addreject codeSigning \
             &gt; /etc/ssl/local/Disabled_Makebelieve_CA_Root.pem &amp;&amp;

          <a id="make-ca-python" name="make-ca-python"></a>Using make-ca with
          Python3
        </h2>
        <p>
          When <span class="application">Python3</span> was installed in
          LFS/MLFS, it included the <span class="application">pip3</span>
          module with vendored certificates from the <span class=
          "application">Certifi</span> module. That was necessary, but it
          means that whenever <span class=
          "command"><strong>pip3</strong></span> is used it can reference
          those certificates, primarily when creating a virtual environment
          or when installing a module with all its wheel dependencies in one
          go.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is generally considered that the System Administrator should be
          in charge of which certificates are available. Now that <a class=
          "xref" href="make-ca.html" title=
          "make-ca-1.16.1">make-ca-1.16.1</a> and <a class="xref" href=
          "p11-kit.html" title="p11-kit-0.25.5">p11-kit-0.25.5</a> have been
          installed and <span class="application">make-ca</span> has been
          configured, it is possible to make <span class=
          "command"><strong>pip3</strong></span> use the system certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vendored certificates installed in LFS are a snapshot from when
          the pulled-in version of <span class="application">Certifi</span>
          was created. If you regularly update the system certificates, the
          vendored version will become out of date.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the system certificates in <span class=
          "application">Python3</span>, you should set <code class=
          "envar">_PIP_STANDALONE_CERT</code> to point to them, e.g for the
          <span class="application">bash</span> shell:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
