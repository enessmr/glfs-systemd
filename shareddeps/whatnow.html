      <p>
        By now, you should have most of the packages needed to compile any
        packages on this page and beyond. The good news is you are now done
        with the hardest part of this book. Congrats!
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, where do you go from here? You could continue straight to the
        following chapters if you wish. But to run graphical programs like
        <a class="xref" href="../steam/steam.html" title=
        "Steam-1.0.0.83">Steam-1.0.0.83</a> and <a class="xref" href=
        "../wine/wine.html" title="Wine-10.9">Wine-10.9</a> (including
        <span class="command"><strong>wineboot</strong></span> as shown in
        the setup for <a class="xref" href="../wine/dxvk.html" title=
        "DXVK-2.6.2">DXVK-2.6.2</a>), you will need a graphical environment.
        There are a few components you will need in order to get a graphical
        environment working and not accidentally lock yourself inside of it
        without a hard reboot. The installation of those components is not
        covered in this book, as the specific components will depend on if
        you plan to use <span class="application">X11</span>, <span class=
        "application">Wayland</span>, or both. This page acts as a simple
        nudge to help point you in the right direction. When you are done
        setting up your graphical environment, you can come back and continue
        with the next chapters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, make sure to install a video userland driver. While no
        sections later in this book depend on the drivers, a graphical
        environment needs a driver. Be sure to read <a class="xref" href=
        "whatdriver.html" title="What Drivers to Install">What Drivers to
        Install</a> and install the driver(s) of your choosing.

        While you are at it, make sure you have followed <a class="xref"
        href="../introduction/bash-profile.html" title=
        "The Bash Shell Startup Files">The Bash Shell Startup Files</a> if
        you have not already as the files in that section set necessary

          It is recommended to read up on the BLFS page <a class="ulink"
          href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/xorg-config.html">
          Xorg-7 Testing and Configuration</a>. It is pretty comprehensive.
          However, using <a class="xref" href="nvidia.html" title=
          "NVIDIA-575.57.08">NVIDIA-575.57.08</a> with <span class=

          <p>
            Using a conventional <code class=
            "filename">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> can lead to issues, if
            <span class="application">X11</span> manages to even start. In
            order to use the <span class="application">NVIDIA</span> driver
            when starting <span class="application">X11</span>, run the
            following command as the <code class="systemitem">root</code>

              The above command will overwrite the current <code class=

            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">X Server Display

            change the Hz located to the right of the screen size. Click
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Apply</span>”</span>
            when you are done, accept the changes, then click <span class=

            File</span>”</span>. If given the option, choose to merge the
            file. Note that this method requires <a class="ulink" href=

            If you have an integrated graphics card (being either AMD or
            Intel) and a discrete graphics card (being NVIDIA), run the
            following as the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user:
          </p>
          <pre class="root"><kbd class=
          "command">nvidia-xconfig --prime</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            It will tell you to run a few commands. While in a TTY, put those
            commands into your <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code> file,
            or else when you start Xorg you will be greeted with a black
            screen. You can also put the commands in a different script and
            use a keybind to open a terminal and blindly execute the script —
            at which point the graphics should appear like normal. Running
            the commands in a TTY will result in complaints that no screens
            were found. Additionally, make sure you have installed drivers
            for both your iGPU and dGPU.

            Using Zink

            This could be considered unstable, so if you experience crashes,

            Gallium3D driver meant for your GPU instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are on a NVIDIA Turing or newer GPU, Zink will be used by
            default instead of Gallium3D Nouveau.

              A window manager is an application that manages windows, their
              placement, how they move, and more. It is a minimal option for
              a graphical environment. Some popular window managers include
              <a class="ulink" href="https://awesomewm.org/">AwesomeWM</a>,
              <a class="ulink" href=

              "ulink" href=
              "https://glfs-book.github.io/slfs/wm/i3.html">i3</a>. In order
              to start your chosen window manager, add the following line to
              <code class="filename">~/.xinitrc</code>:
            </p>
            <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">echo "exec <em class=

              Then launch it:

              A desktop environment is a more user-friendly graphical
              environment which provides much more than a standard window
              manager <a href="#ftn.id15069" class="footnote" id="id15069"
              name="id15069"><sup class="footnote">[9]</sup></a>. However,
              desktop environments also require more packages, RAM usage, and
              disk space. Some popular desktop environments include <a class=
              "ulink" href=

              By this point, you should know what a terminal is, whether it
              be a TTY or a graphical terminal. Terminals are almost a
              necessity and help when you are in a pinch. You can launch most
              applications with a terminal. This is useful when you have no
              other way to launch an application. There are a wide variety of
              terminals and some integrate better with the system depending
              on if you went with a window manager or desktop environment.
              Check the Arch Wiki page <a class="ulink" href=
              "https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Terminal_emulators">Category:Terminal
              emulators</a> for a comprehensive list of terminals. Some of
              the listed terminals are in BLFS. If you decided to go with a
              window manager, make sure to add a keybind for your chosen
              terminal.

              A launcher is what it sounds like: an application that launches
              a specified application. Some launch applications by the binary
              name in the <code class="envar">PATH</code> variable, while
              others launch applications according to desktop file
              entries<a href="#ftn.id15081" class="footnote" id="id15081"

            You will only need to worry about the refresh rate if it's
            applicable to you. You won't need to worry about making sure the
            <span class="application">NVIDIA</span> driver is used when
            starting <span class="application">Wayland</span>. However, read
            through the installation instructions for your chosen graphical
            environment, as they may have information regarding <span class=
            "application">NVIDIA</span>. Results can be shotty, and sometimes
            the environment won't be able to start. Do your research first.

            Window Managers, Desktop Environments, and Compositors
          </h3>
          <p>
            Unlike on <span class="application">X11</span>, the window
            manager and compositor will always be combined on <span class=
            "application">Wayland</span>. Minimal graphical environments are
            called compositors instead of window managers, but desktop
            environments are still called desktop environments. For
            compositors, the only additional components that need to be
            installed are a terminal and optionally a launcher.

              Many <span class="application">X11</span> window managers do
              not support <span class="application">Wayland</span>. There are
              some unofficial ports that use certain reusable frameworks
              which would be called an <span class="application">X11</span>
              compositor, like <a class="ulink" href=
              "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/">wlroots</a>
              (these are called compositor libraries). You can try some ports
              if you wish but some of them do their own thing which you may
              not agree with.

              Native <span class="application">Wayland</span> compositors
              include <a class="ulink" href=

              In order to start these compositors, you can start them by
              using a display manager or simply running their binary.

            If you decide to use a compositor, it might be a good idea to

            Note that some window managers handle compositing on their own.
