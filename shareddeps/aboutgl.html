          What is OpenGL?
        </h2>
        <p>
          OpenGL is a graphics API that was developed by Silicon Graphics,
          Inc. which started off as IRIS GL. It was developed to be
          cross-platform as getting graphics to work had previously been
          different on each set of hardware. Due to pressure from other
          competitors, SGI open sourced IRIS GL and called it OpenGL.
          Nowadays, OpenGL is now managed by Khronos Group who also manages
          Vulkan. However, they define the standards of the APIs, but don't
          make drivers for the APIs, nor implement the calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, <span class="application">Mesa</span> came in and implemented
          drivers and functions for OpenGL. They also implement GLX and EGL
          which provide interfaces to window systems like <span class=
          "application">Xorg</span>. However, their method doesn't dispatch
          the calls in a vendor-neutral way. For the most part, this approach
          is fine and doesn't lead to any issues. <span class=
          "application">NVIDIA</span> has decided that this was a bad enough
          approach to warrant making another implementation of OpenGL called
          <span class="application">libglvnd</span>. It only provides the
          implementations for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, GLX, and EGL. This had led
          to legacy OpenGL vs new OpenGL on Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is <code class="filename">libGL</code> which is now
          considered legacy OpenGL and is provided by both <a class="xref"
          href="mesa.html" title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a> and <a class=
          "xref" href="libglvnd.html" title=
          "libglvnd-1.7.0">libglvnd-1.7.0</a>. Meanwhile, there is
          <code class="filename">libOpenGL</code> which is considered the new
          OpenGL and is only provided by <a class="xref" href="libglvnd.html"
          title="libglvnd-1.7.0">libglvnd-1.7.0</a>. Apps and libraries that
          link against the legacy OpenGL will work with both providers, but
          linking against the new OpenGL, which only has dispatching
          functions, will result in those binaries being broken on systems
          with only <a class="xref" href="mesa.html" title=
          "Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a> installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is only a problem for binary only packages and some
          <span class="application">CMake</span> build systems. For this book
          and in BLFS, you shouldn't run into any of those issues unless you
          wish to use <a class="xref" href="nvidia.html" title=
          "NVIDIA-575.57.08">NVIDIA-575.57.08</a>, which specifically
          requires <a class="xref" href="libglvnd.html" title=
          "libglvnd-1.7.0">libglvnd-1.7.0</a>. SLFS aims to work around
          issues that arise from packages having stubborn build systems, like
          in the case of <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://glfs-book.github.io/slfs/general/obs-studio.html">OBS-Studio</a>.
          For binary-only packages, it is generally hit or miss whether the
          developers link against new or legacy OpenGL. A gaming example is
          with ports and recompilations: the binary for <a class="ulink"
          href="https://www.shipofharkinian.com/">Ship of Harkinian</a>, a PC
          port of the Nintendo 64 game, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,
          links against new OpenGL and will be broken with only <span class=
          "application">Mesa</span> installed; furthermore, trying to get
          around the issue by building from source also leads to many issues.
          However, the binary of the PC port made from statically recompiling
          the Nintendo 64 game, Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, called
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp">Zelda 64:
          Recompiled</a>, links against legacy OpenGL and works with both
          OpenGL providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you only want legacy OpenGL, you can just install <a class=
          "xref" href="mesa.html" title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a>. If you
          want new OpenGL, support for some binary-only packages, <a class=
          "xref" href="nvidia.html" title=
          "NVIDIA-575.57.08">NVIDIA-575.57.08</a>, and get past some
          <span class="application">CMake</span> build systems, install
          <a class="xref" href="libglvnd.html" title=
          "libglvnd-1.7.0">libglvnd-1.7.0</a>. If you want a driver from
          <a class="xref" href="mesa.html" title=
          "Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a>, you can build that after
          <span class="application">libglvnd</span>. <span class=
          "application">Mesa</span> will auto-detect <span class=
          "application">libglvnd</span> and will skip building its OpenGL
          implementations.

            What is GLES?
          </h3>
          <p>
            GLES, or OpenGL ES, or OpenGL for Embedded Systems, is what the
            full name suggests: it is a stripped down version of OpenGL, a
            subset, with a slightly different API here and there. It is used
            mostly for devices with ARM chips such as smart phones and
            tablets, but is also used in gaming consoles. On the Linux
            desktop, you typically have desktop, or full, OpenGL, EGL, GLX,
            and GLESv{1,2,3}.
          </p>
          <p>
            GLES, specifically v2 and v3, are used sometimes, but mostly in
            one area. Such an area is in <span class=
            "application">Wayland</span> compositors and compositor
            libraries, such as <span class="application">Hyprland</span>,
            <span class="application">Mutter</span>, <span class=
            "application">Wayfire</span>, and <span class=
            "application">Wlroots</span>. While compositors can utilize
            Vulkan, most compositors require GLES rendering and don't offer a
            Vulkan solution, or any other rendering API solution. GLESv1 on
            the otherhand is an outdated specification of the GLES API that
            has been phased out for many years. This book disables building
            for GLESv1 as it is deprecated. You may build the API spec if you
            wish.

            History of Wayland and GLES
          </h3>
          <p>
            When the <span class="application">Wayland</span> set of
            protocols were made, a reference implementation had to be made
            for it to show what was possible, and how to create a compositor
            for the new protocol. The result was <span class=
            "application">Weston</span>. For its rendering API, it used, and
            uses, GLES and EGL. This was done so that the dependency on the
            libraries from the <span class="application">X</span> Window
            System wasn't needed, that a Wayland-only setup was possible. A
            small benefit of using GLES was that it could run on embedded
            systems like Raspberry Pis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, compositors and compositor libraries followed suite and did
            the same thing. However, any rendering API can be used as long as
            it can be put through EGL. Desktop OpenGL and Vulkan can be used
            with no issues. Today, the situation is the same and most
            compositors don't accept any other rendering API besides GLES.
          </p>

        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <h3 class="sect3">
            Do I need GLES?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you are wanting to use Wayland compositors, and are going to
            use one that does not support Vulkan rendering, you are very
            likely going to have to build GLES v2 and v3, or else OpenGL and
            EGL rendering will not be an option. There are very few Wayland
            compositors that support Vulkan and do not require GLES. If you
            do find one, like <a class="ulink" href=
            "https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl">dwl</a>, you won't really need
            GLES beyond compositing. Wayland clients, which are applications,
            will typically just use OpenGL and/or Vulkan with EGL. This means
            that you would be able to skip GLES support but would kill off
            the ability to use other Wayland compositors that require GLES
            rendering.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the otherhand, if you are using the <span class=
            "application">X</span> Window System, GLES will almost never be
            used and that support for the API can be disabled without much
            worry. However, you kill off the ability to use Wayland
            compositors that require GLES rendering if you want to switch
            over to Wayland in the future.

            Disabling GLES
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you decided to disable GLES support, it is pretty easy to not
            build in support for the API. In <span class=
            "quote">“<span class="quote">Command Explanations</span>”</span>,
            for both <a class="xref" href="libglvnd.html" title=
            "libglvnd-1.7.0">libglvnd-1.7.0</a> and <a class="xref" href=
            "mesa.html" title="Mesa-25.1.2">Mesa-25.1.2</a>, they will
            explain the options required to disable the support. Furthermore,
            <a class="xref" href="nvidia.html" title=
            "NVIDIA-575.57.08">NVIDIA-575.57.08</a> installs drivers for
            GLES. The installation instructions for that driver will cover
            how to delete them if you do not need GLES.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you already have installed GLES from any of the OpenGL
            providers, removing all the related files is pretty easy. You can
            follow the instructions below as the <code class=
            "systemitem">root</code> user to remove the API:
          </p>
          <pre class="root"><kbd class="command">for libdir in /usr/lib*; do
  rm -vf  $libdir/pkgconfig/gles*
  rm -vrf /usr/include/GLES*
  rm -vf  $libdir/libGLES*
done
ldconfig</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Recompile any packages as necessary to remove the dependency on
            GLES.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have decided to revert your decision and wish to build
            support for GLES, just recompile OpenGL from the original OpenGL
            provider you went with without the option needed to disable
            GLESv2. You can however keep the option to disable GLESv1 as v1
            is an outdated spec and not needed today.
