        <span class="application">MinGW-w64</span> itself is a package
        providing headers, C runtime libraries, and much more. When support
        for it is built into compilers such as <span class=
        "application">GCC</span>, it enables the building of software
        targetting Windows, such as programs and libraries. This software is
        aimed to be used on Windows, but can also be used on Linux.

          <span class="application">LLVM</span> can also be used for the
          toolchain. This book will use <span class="application">GCC</span>
          instead as it has easier instructions, quicker build times, and
          saves disk space.

        <a class="xref" href="wine.html" title="Wine-10.9">Wine-10.9</a>
        depends on this functionality to build DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries),
        or the equivalent of Linux dynamic libraries, appended with the
        suffix <code class="filename">.so</code>, or Shared Objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of Windows software is dynamically linked. While most of them
        when shipped include DLLs packaged in the installed directory, or
        extracted from a ZIP file, not all DLLs will be packaged as a number
        will be installed on a given Windows machine already, such as
        libraries for DirectX/Direct3D support. Since we are on a Unix-like
        operating system, we do not have such DLLs installed on the system,
        and they were never compiled in LFS or earlier in this book.
        <a class="xref" href="../shareddeps/nvidia.html" title=
        "NVIDIA-575.57.08">NVIDIA-575.57.08</a> does install two DLL files
        but are strictly meant for <span class="application">Wine</span> and
        Proton. <span class="application">MinGW-w64</span> does not install
        these libraries, so <span class="application">Wine</span> needs to
        compile them for most Windows software to function.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a developer and wish to target Windows, this toolchain
        should be pretty useful. You won't need to follow any of the chapters
        after this one if you just want the MinGW-w64 toolchain. It is
        recommended to still install <span class="application">Wine</span>
        for sanity checks revolving around your built software you are
        developing, although it isn't a perfect replacement for an accurate
        Windows environment. While the built software may work fine with
        <span class="application">Wine</span>, it could be totally broken on
        Windows. An example is linking against libraries installed by
        <span class="application">Wine</span> or <span class=
        "application">MinGW-w64</span> and Windows complaining that Unixlib
        can not be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following process works up to building the pieces for a static
        compilation of GCC, which means it cannot do much of anything with
        dynamic libraries besides build them. This is especially a problem
        with C++ software as you need <code class=
        "filename">libstdc++</code>, which should be dynamic, for linking and
        execution. This is also a problem for software that uses atomic. Most
        of all, Windows software built with the toolchain needs <code class=
        "filename">libgcc_s_seh</code> which is not provided in the static
        build.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this barebones basic toolchain is enough to build up the
        remaining pieces of the toolchain. After doing so, you can rebuild
        GCC and have a complete toolchain ready for targetting Windows.
        Realistically, you could grab a binary distribution of the toolchain
        and compile everything with less steps. In the past, that is exactly
        what this book has done. GLFS editors/contributors since then have
        decided to scrap that idea <a href="#ftn.id15554" class="footnote"
        id="id15554" name="id15554"><sup class="footnote">[13]</sup></a> and
        have chosen to bootstrap the toolchain instead.

            rationale behind bootstrapping the MinGW-w64 toolchain. The issue
            originates from the old Github repository the GLFS project was
            once hosted.
